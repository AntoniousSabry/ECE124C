        <h1>Playing Tennis Safely: Player Tips and Recommendations</h1>
        <img src="tennis2.jpg" height="200">
    </center>
    <p>
        The USTA recognizes that the coronavirus has been affecting different parts of the country in different ways and with different timing.
         We therefore believe it will be possible for people to return to playing tennis safely in some cities and states sooner than in others.<br>
The Federal Government issued guidelines on April 16 for “Opening Up America Again” at WhiteHouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. By following these 
guidelines as well as those of local governments and health agencies, facilities and players will be able to make informed decisions as
 to when play can recommence. <br>
If you live in a community where stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders have been lifted or modified, and if your locality meets
 the standards in the Federal Guidelines, then tennis, if played properly, can be a great opportunity for you to relieve stress, 
 socialize with others and provide much-needed exercise. Of primary importance is taking every precaution to help keep all participants safe. <br>
Because tennis does not require any direct person-to-person contact, players can enjoy the many physical and mental benefits 
that tennis offers so long as you practice physical distancing by keeping six feet apart from other players to ensure you are 
in a safe exercise environment and follow other safety recommendations included here.<br>
Although there is no specific evidence that tennis balls can spread COVID-19, we know that contamination by respiratory 
droplets from an infected person can potentially survive on hard surfaces up to three days. If you choose to play tennis, 
be sure to practice these safety tips and recommendations.<br>

        <h1>USTA Statement on Suspension of Events</h1>

    <p>
        The USTA recognizes that the coronavirus has been affecting different parts of the country in different ways and with different timing.
         Because of that, it will be possible for people to return to playing tennis safely in some cities and states sooner than in others.<br>
At present, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders have been lifted or modified in some communities, and some are phasing tennis back 
in as a safe, or in certain cases, an “essential,” activity.<br>
Beginning June 1, the suspension of USTA Sanctioned products and events noted below will now be at the discretion of the USTA
 Sections and local health authorities. These USTA Sanctioned products and events include:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adult and Junior Tournaments</li>
        <li>USTA League</li>
        <li>USTA Junior Team Tennis</li>
        <li>USTA Social Leagues</li>
        <li>Team Challenge</li>
        <li>Team Tournaments</li>
        <li>USTA School Programs</li>
        <li>Tennis on Campus</li>
        <li>Wheelchair Tennis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
The safety and well-being of all players and event personnel remains the first and foremost consideration of the USTA.
 All players should check their USTA Section homepage to determine when these USTA Sanctioned products and events will
  resume and under what conditions. In all cases, the USTA highly recommends that all players and facilities adhere to
   the “Playing Tennis Safely” guidelines, as well as all local health and safety regulations when returning to play.<br>
Please note the additional national suspensions below that are still in effect across the country: <br>
All Category 1 and Super Category 2 National Adult Tournaments with an ITF status, all ITF Junior events,
 all Adults Category 2 and Category 3 tournaments, all Wheelchair L1 - L3 events, and all USTA Pro Circuit
  events will align with the same calendar as the ITF and be suspended through July 31. The ATP has also 
  suspended events through July 31, while the WTA has suspended select events in July. In addition, the USTA
   has made the decision, separately, to cancel the 2020 National Clay Court Championships scheduled for July
    11-19, and which would have taken place in seven cities across three states.<br>
“The impact of COVID-19 has been felt across the tennis landscape, and it is our goal to ensure that the 
sport is able to be played in a safe and healthy fashion at the parks and facilities throughout the country
 once the pandemic subsides,” said Patrick Galbraith, Chairman of the Board and President, USTA. “One of the
  greatest aspects of this game is that it fosters a true community, and we look forward to the time when we
   can return to our local courts and use tennis to unite us all, once again.”  <br>
The determination has also been made to suspend the calculation and publication of the National
 Standings List (NSL) for Adult, Junior and Wheelchair play until further notice. The NSL published
  on March 18 will serve as the most current until tournament competition resumes.<br>
