    <p>
        The NBA confirmed Thursday that the league will return with a shortened team format at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida.<br>
''The NBA Board of Governors today approved a competitive format to restart the 2019-20 season with 22 teams returning to
 play and a tentative start date of Friday, July 31. The Board’s approval is the first formal step among many required 
 to resume the season,” the league said.<br>
“The season restart is also contingent on an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to use Walt Disney World
 Resort near Orlando, Florida, as a single site for a campus for all games, practices and housing for the
  remainder of the season," it also said.<br>
"Based on the competitive format that the NBA Board of Governors approved today, the 22 returning 
teams would be the 16 teams (eight per conference) in current playoff positions and the six teams 
that are currently six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in their respective conferences.<br>
"Those two groups comprise teams with the NBA’s 22 best records," added the league.<br>
Like other sports tournaments and leagues worldwide, the NBA season was suspended in March due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.<br>

        Italian basketball club AX Armani Exchange Milan reached an agreement with center Kaleb Tarczewski until 2023, the club announced Saturday.<br>
"I am so grateful for the opportunity to continue my career with Olimpia Milano. Over the past three and a half years, this city
 and it’s people have become home for me. I can’t wait to get back on the court and fight for the city of Milan,
 " Tarczewski said on the club's website.<br>

He appeared in 82 EuroLeague games, averaging 8.1 points and 5.8 rebounds.<br>
“Kaleb is a player who represents very well Olimpia’s traditional values.
 We are happy that he made the choice to continue to be part of our family," said General Manager Christos Stavropoulos.<br>
