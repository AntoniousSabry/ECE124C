    <p>
        English Premier League club Southampton extended the contract of Shane Long until the end of 2021-2022 season.<br>
"The Republic of Ireland international had been approaching the end of his pre-existing deal this summer,
 but is now set to remain with Saints until the end of the 2021/22 season," the club announced on Thursday.<br>
Long, 33, joined Southampton from Hull City of England in 2014.<br>
He scored 35 goals and produced 26 assists in 205 matches for Southampton.<br>
"I love the way the club is run, I love what the club stands for and I'm excited about what the club will 
do over the next couple of years," Long said in a statement on the club's website.<br>
"I can see the club pushing up the league, back to where we all want to be, and I want to be 
part of that. I’m just delighted to get it done."<br>

    <p>
        Clubs in England’s top football league will be allowed to make up to five substitutions during matches for the rest of the season.<br>
In a statement on Thursday, the Premier League said increasing the maximum number of substitutions from three to five was
 part of “temporary changes.”<br>
“Premier League Shareholders today agreed temporary changes to the rules relating to substitute players.
 For the remainder of the 2019/20 season, the number of substitutes that can be used during a match will 
 increase from three to five players,” read the statement.<br>
It said the number of substitute players on the bench was also increased from seven to nine.<br>
England's top-flight football competition will restart on June 17 without fans in stadiums after a three-month
 break due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br>
The first matches -- Manchester City vs Arsenal and Aston Villa vs Sheffield United -- 
will be played mid-week, followed by a full round on the June 19-21 weekend.<br>
There are 92 remaining fixtures in the 2019-2020 season, with Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool at the top
 with a 25-point lead and certain to be crowned champions.<br>
